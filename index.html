                    <h3>Why Staples?</h3>
                    <p>Originally, this project was made for my good friend and teacher, Mr. Staples. He teaches in
                        elementary school and wanted something to help him give out electronic tests to his students
                        without making it "gameified" like many other quiz softwares do.</p>
